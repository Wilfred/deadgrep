There are several great Emacs search tools available! I have learnt
lots when playing with these and reading their source code. You might
even find you end up using these as well as deadgrep, depending on
your workflow.

## counsel

[Counsel](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) provides the command
`counsel-rg` (and similar commands `counsel-ag` and `counsel-ack`).

These provide as-you-type search results. This is a different style of
working to deadgrep.el, and it's a great complementary tool.

## ag.el

[ag.el](https://github.com/Wilfred/ag.el/) allows you to use `ag` for
Emacs searches. I wrote it, but I've learnt a lot about good search
UIs since I built ag.el.

`ag` is not quite as fast as `rg`, so results come more slowly. Note
that [`rg` currently doesn't support multiline
searches](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/176), unlike `ag`.

ag.el has a lot of search commands to memorise:

* `ag`
* `ag-project`
* `ag-project-files`
* `ag-files`
* `ag-regexp`
* `ag-project-regexp`

This only covers some of the possible filter combinations, and caused
confusion for users who expected regexp search to be the default.

Results buffers here are much busier, showing superfluous
information. This is because ag.el is built on top of
`compilation-mode`, which isn't a great fit for searching.

ag.el has a few tests, but coverage is significantly lower than
deadgrep.

ag.el has support for editing files from the results buffer, using
[wgrep](https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep).

## rg.el

[rg.el](https://github.com/dajva/rg.el) targets `rg`, and the results
buffer shows what type of search occurred.

However, it's still built on `compilation-mode`, and does not group
results by file. It also (as far as I can tell) always prompts for a
directory and a file type, requiring additional keystrokes.

rg.el is very thoroughly tested.

## ripgrep.el

[ripgrep.el](https://github.com/nlamirault/ripgrep.el), and
projectile-ripgrep (part of the same project), is an alternative to
rg.el.

This is also using `compilation-mode` without grouping
results. `projectile-ripgrep` saves you needing to specify the search
directory (just like deadgrep and ag.el).

## socyl

[Socyl](https://github.com/nlamirault/socyl) is a generic text search
tool that supports `rg` plus others.

![screenshot](./socyl_screenshot.png)

Socyl is also based on `compilation-mode`, and does not group results
by file. As it's generic, users must specify a search backend, as well
as specifying the directory on every invocation.

## grep

`M-x grep` is a built-in Emacs command.

![screenshot](./grep_screenshot.png)

Users must specify the glob and the search term as part of a raw
`grep` command. This means your `.gitignore` is ignored, unlike `rg`,
`ag` or `ack`. This command also uses `compilation-mode`.
